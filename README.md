## Relational-Database_Case-Study_Twitter

## Abstract
This is a case study project on Twitter, a prominent social media platform. The project focuses on explaining the concept of schema design and relationships between entities in relational databases using Twitter as a case study. The case study offers a comprehensive dissection of Twitter's platform, highlighting its company overview, real-world challenges related to social interaction, and Twitter's solutions to these challenges. Additionally, the study includes an examination of Twitter's top features, a high-level schema design based on these features, an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) based on the schema design, and a concluding analysis.

## Introduction
Twitter has revolutionized global communication through its dynamic social media platform, facilitating real-time interactions and information sharing. This project aims to conduct an in-depth dissection of Twitter, with a focus on schema design and the creation of an Entity Relationship Diagram essential for relational database management.

## Problem Statement
1. What real-world challenges are faced by users in social interaction, and how does Twitter address those challenges?
2. What is the schema design of Twitter based on the entities and relationships identified from the top features of the platform?
3. Based on the schema design, create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to explain the complexities of integrity and associations in relational databases.

## Approach and Methodology
The case study is divided into the following sections:
1. Company Overview: This covers a brief history of Twitter as a company and a social media platform, as well as its most significant and popular features.
2. Detailed Product Dissection: This section addresses the real-world challenges users face in social interaction and how Twitter's innovative solutions help mitigate these issues. The major problems covered include:
   - Real-time information dissemination
   - Direct public engagement
   - Personal branding 
   - Trend discovery
   - Multimedia content sharing
3. Top Features: This section covers the top features of the Twitter platform.
4. Schema Description: This section elaborates on a high-level schema design of Twitter based on its top features. The entities identified include:
   - User Entity
   - Tweet Entity
   - Hashtag Entity
   - Follower Entity
   - Direct Message Entity
   - Media Entity
   - Trending Topics Entity
   This section also covers the relationships between these entities.
5. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): This section displays the ERD that vividly portrays the relationships and attributes of the entities within the Twitter schema.
6. Conclusion: This section presents the final conclusion of the Twitter Case Study Project.

## Contributions
This project is based on information available from the Twitter platform and official resources. The ER Diagram is created using an online tool for visualization.

## Challenges
The major challenges faced involved setting up the schema design. Understanding how the platform's features are interconnected helped in identifying the main entities and the relationships between them.

## Conclusion
A comprehensive dissection of the Twitter platform has provided insights into how the innovative features and offerings address the real-world challenges faced in the domain of social media interaction. This process has facilitated the identification of top features, schema design, and the creation of an ER Diagram for its relational database management system.
